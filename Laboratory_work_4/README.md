# Laboratory work 4

This laboratory work focuses on the implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier. The classifier is implemented in the `SPAMFilter` class.
 
## Dataset
Files are in the spam.rar file and ham.rar file. These files must be unzipped in the `data` directory.

## Usage
The `SPAMFilter` class is used as follows:
```python
from SPAMFilter import SPAMFilter
```
